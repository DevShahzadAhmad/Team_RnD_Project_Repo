## Maximum Heart Rate and Heart Disease – Statistical Analysis in R


This repository contains all files, code, and documentation for our group project investigating maximum heart rate (MaxHR) differences between patients with and without heart disease. This analysis was conducted as part of the 7COM1079-0901-2025 module (Team Research and Development Project).

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a clinical heart-disease dataset to answer the following research question:

### **Research Question (RQ)**  
**Is there a difference in the mean maximum heart rate (MaxHR) between patients with and without heart disease?**

To address this, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated visualisations (boxplots, histograms with normal curves), performed descriptive statistics, and carried out a Welch’s independent-samples t-test. All analysis was produced using R.
