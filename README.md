## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a clinical heart-disease dataset to answer the following research question:

### **Research Question (RQ)**  
**Is there a difference in the mean maximum heart rate (MaxHR) between patients with and without heart disease?**

To address this, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), generated visualisations (boxplots, histograms with normal curves), performed descriptive statistics, and carried out a Welch’s independent-samples t-test. All analysis was produced using R.
